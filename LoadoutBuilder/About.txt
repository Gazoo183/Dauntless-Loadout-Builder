This database is based on game Dauntless by Phoenix Labs.
It's main purpose is to allow creation and storage of loadouts for your character.
Each loadout consists of weapon, lantern and one piece of each armour type (head, torso, arms, legs).
Each of those items has from one to two sockets that allow allocation of cells. Every socket and cell 
can be of one out of five types (Utility, Technique, Power, Defence, Mobility). 
Socket can only hold a cell of the same type as the one it has.
